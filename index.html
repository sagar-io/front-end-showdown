                            The Colosseum is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just
                            east
                            of
                            the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest
                            standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor
                            Vespasian
                            (r. 69–79 AD) in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus (r.
                            79–81).
                            Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96). The three emperors
                            who
                            were
                            patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the
                            Flavian
                            Amphitheatre by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family
                            name
                            (Flavius).

                            Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking spolia, the Colosseum
                            is
                            still
                            an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and was <strong> listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the
                                World.</strong>
                            It is
                            one
                            of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church,
                            as
                            each
                            Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that starts in the area
                            around
                            the Colosseum. The Colosseum is depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin.

                                The Colosseum underwent several radical changes of use. By the late 6th century a small
                                chapel had been built into the structure of the amphitheater, though this apparently did
                                not
                                confer any particular religious significance on the building as a whole. The arena was
                                converted into a cemetery. The numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating
                                were
                                converted into housing and workshops, and are recorded as still being rented out as late
                                as
                                the 12th century. Around 1200 the Frangipani family took over the Colosseum and
                                fortified
                                it, apparently using it as a castle. In the early to mid 14th century, the Pope's
                                relocation
                                to Avignon caused a population decline in Rome that left the region insecure. The
                                colosseum
                                was largely abandoned by the public and became a popular den for bandits.

                            <p>Severe damage was inflicted on the Colosseum by the great earthquake in 1349, causing the
                                outer south side, lying on a less stable alluvial terrain, to collapse. Much of the
                                tumbled
                                stone was reused to build palaces, churches, hospitals and other buildings elsewhere in
                                Rome. In 1377, after the Pope's return to Rome, the Colosseum was restored by a
                                religious
                                order called Arciconfraternita del SS. Salvatore ad Sancta Sanctorum, who then inhabited
                                a
                                northern portion of it until as late as the early 19th century. The interior of the
                                amphitheater was extensively stripped of stone, which was reused elsewhere, or (in the
                                case
                                of the marble façade) was burned to make quicklime. The iron clamps which held the
                                stonework
                                together were pried or hacked out of the walls, leaving numerous pockmarks which still
                                scar
                                the building today.

                                    top of the seating area to shade the spectators and protect them from the scorching

                                    stopped in 435 AD and the last animal hunts were in 532 CE. This was partly due to
                                    the
                                    cost of acquiring animals and gladiators, alongside maintaining the arena.</li>
                                <li>It’s estimated that over 400,000 people and over a million wild animals died during

                                    centuries that the games took place.</li>
